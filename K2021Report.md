## Introduction

### What is KeikkaKaveri

KeikkaKaveri is a web app developed to assist temporary workers in their work.

KeikkaKaveri is developed by Metropolia in collaboration with (TODO)various organizations for Työturvallisuuskeskus(TTK, the Centre for Occupational Safety). 

The app is developed to (TODO)fit/implement parts of the model provided by Tampereen teknillinen yliopisto(TTY, Tampere University of Technology), namely the three-way communication of relevant parties (TODO)(agency, worker, customer) and to display information relevant to all who need it.

### Completeness and history


### Priorities and ideas for future developers

Priorities for future development should revolve around the three-way-interface that includes the worker, their agency and the customer. The app should also continue to implement the TTY model.

Ideas for future development:
  1. Internationalization: Accessible in Finnish, Swedish and English.
  2. Admin role: Develop a role for administration to maintain the userspace - adding articles to the "feed", managing users(enforcing terms etc).
  3. Seed data: 
  4. Documentation: Generating (automated) documentation for the codebase.
  5. Testing: Much of the Frontend is not covered.
